# Volunteer Developers

The technical infrastructure and software behind arXiv.org is operated and
maintained by a core team of dedicated IT staff at Cornell University. However,
it would not be possible to keep pace with the ever-changing landscape of
internet technology, nor the evolving needs of 21st century science, without
the help of dedicated arXiv users who contribute to the open source software
that powers the arXiv platform.

We are grateful to the following volunteer developers for their contributions to
the arXiv codebase:
