## Search
Enter a few title words and/or author names and/or abstract words into
the "**Search or Article-id**" box in the top right of most pages
(including this one) or you can use the [Advanced Search](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced)

## If you know the identifier
All arXiv submissions are assigned a unique identifier of the form
`yymm.nnnnn` (or `arch-ive/yymmnnn` for older submissions). To retrieve
the abstract page a paper simply enter the identifier in the "**Search
or Article-id**" box in the top right of most pages.

You can also construct the URL (web address) for a paper with a given
identifier as `http://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>`. For example,

     http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9603067
     http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0123

From the abstract page you will be able to choose your preferred format
for [downloading and viewing](../view.md) the paper.
